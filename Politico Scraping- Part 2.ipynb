      "White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said she didn't see \"any contradiction or confusion\" after a pair of President Donald Trump's tweets on a surveillance initiative prompted scrambling by lawmakers Thursday. \n",
      "“We don’t think there was a conflict at all,\" Sanders said at the daily press briefing. \n",
      "Trump caused confusion on Capitol Hill Thursday when he initially appeared to undermine a Republican-led effort to reauthorize part of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, a set of controversial government surveillance tools. The White House had previously supported the measure.\n",
      "\"'House votes on controversial FISA ACT today.' This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others?\" the president tweeted. The post came shortly after a \"Fox & Friends\" contributor made a direct plea to the president to reverse his stance on the bill. \n",
      "Trump tweeted later in the morning, however, that he still supported the push to reauthorize FISA.\n",
      "\"With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land. We need it! Get smart!\" he wrote. \n",
      "Sign up for POLITICO Playbook and get the latest news, every morning — in your inbox.\n",
      "Lawmakers were perplexed by the remarks, which threw uncertainty into the proceedings in the hours leading up to the House vote. \n",
      "Sanders dismissed the notion that the president didn't fully grasp the surveillance measure, saying he has “full understanding” of the bill. \n",
      "The bill, which passed by a 256-164 vote, will now head to the Senate, where it is expected to pass. \n",
