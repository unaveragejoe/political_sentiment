       "'\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Wednesday apologized again for identifying herself as an \"American Indian\" on a 1986 registration card for the State Bar of Texas and more broadly for not being \"mindful of the distinction with tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty,\" but she would not clarify whether there were additional documents where she declared Native American status, NBC News reports.\\n\"This is who I grew up believing with my brothers, this is our family story, it\\'s all consistent from that point in time,\" said Warren, who is expected to announce her presidential candidacy this Saturday.\\n\"But as I said, it\\'s important to note I\\'m not a tribal citizen, and I should have been more mindful of the distinction with tribal citizenship and tribal sovereignty and that is why I apologized to [Cherokee Nation] Chief [Bill John] Baker and why I\\'ve made a very public apology about this.\"\\nThe Washington Post on Tuesday reported on Warren\\'s registration card disclosure for the State Bar of Texas. The Texas bar registration card is significant, among other reasons, because it removes any doubt Warren directly claimed the identity.\\xa0\\nTwo reporters asked whether additional documents with similar information would be found, but Warren answered with the same response.\\n\"All I know is during this time period this is consistent with what I did because it was based on my understanding from my family\\'s stories, but family\\'s stories are not the same as tribal citizenships and this is why I have apologized both to Chief Baker and have apologized publicly,\"\\xa0she said.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n'"
